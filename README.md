# MicroMouse
NYIT IEEE Micro Mouse Group Project(3rd Place)

Mouse Description:
The constructed mouse resembled a car, featuring front wheels for steering and rear wheels for propulsion. To navigate the maze, the Floodfill algorithm and Manhattan distance were utilized. IR sensors and magnetic encoders facilitated efficient traversal. The IR sensors identified the availability of turns and dictated whether to proceed straight or prompted a reversal. Meanwhile, the encoder, in tandem with the Manhattan distance, calculated the optimal path to the goal.

Micromouse Rules:
The max size of the micro mouse is 25cm x 25cm (for the entire duration of the maze). There is no restriction
on height. The mouse must solve the maze and cannot bypass it.

Maze specifications:
  1. Each cell is 18cm x 18cm
  2. Each maze is comprised of 16 x 16 celt
  3. The maze is entirely enclosed on the outside
  4.  The walls are white, the tops are red and the floor is black
